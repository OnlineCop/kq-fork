	Player is partially visible when exiting buildings diagonally.  Added a few more "black" strips to cover the player better.

2009-04-27  teamterradactyl  <teamterradactyl@iMac.local>

	* maps/makefile: Needed to add mapstructs.o to mapdraw's executable.

2008-01-29  evoguenther  <evoguenther@iMac.local>

	* Makefile.am, README_MINGW.txt, configure.ac, po/de.po, src/enemyc.c, src/intrface.c:

	Some harmless cleanups

	* scripts/Makefile.am: use portable make

2008-01-28  edgarmolina  <edgarmolina@iMac.local>

	* po/es.po: more spanish

	* scripts/cave3a.lua: gettext lines

	* scripts/town1.lua: Spanish translation

	* po/kq.pot: Spanish translations

	* po/es.po: Spanish translation

	* scripts/fort.lua: Some translations

2008-01-20  peterhull90  <peterhull90@iMac.local>

	* data/mpcx.dat, src/draw.c, src/kq.c:
	Changes to allow accented characters for language translations.
	* Modified datafile with new glyphs
	* Modified UTF-8 support to find those glyphs
	* Modified main file to allow the larger glyph bitmap

2008-01-16  wk2  <wk2@iMac.local>

	* maps/mapedit2.c, maps/mapedit2.h, src/bounds.c, include/bounds.h, maps/mainwindow.c, maps/mapdraw2.c, maps/mapdraw2.glade:
	* Added shadows to mapdraw2
	* Added bounding boxes to mapdraw2
	* Misc fixes.

	* maps/mainwindow.c, maps/mapdraw2.c, maps/mapdraw2.glade, maps/mapedit2.c, maps/mapedit2.h:
	* made mapdraw2's current_value text box behavior less weird.
	* made it so that you could place tiles in mapdraw2 by dragging the mouse over the map area.
	* fixed a bug that sometimes resulted in phantom entities with maps saved with mapdraw2. Sometimes, after deleting an
	entity, and then saving the map, the entity would come back.
	* made the function names in mapdraw2 more consistent, and rearranged some functions to make them easier to find.

2008-01-15  wk2  <wk2@iMac.local>

	* maps/mainwindow.c, maps/mapdraw2.c, maps/mapdraw2.glade, maps/mapedit2.c, maps/mapedit2.h, maps/mapstructs.c:
	* Added the ability to create new maps from within mapdraw2. mapdraw2 no longer needs mapdraw's assistance (although some
	things are still easier in mapdraw).
	* Properly aligned mapdraw2.glade. This was done automatically when I saved the new file with glade-3.

2008-01-14  peterhull90  <peterhull90@iMac.local>

	* src/osx.m:
	Added path searching as implemented by wk2 for unix and windows

2008-01-14  wk2  <wk2@iMac.local>

	* src/unix.c:
	* Made "get_lua_file_path more flexible, so it can be ported to kq.c, and used for all OSes.
	* Changed the clunky "open file to see if it exists" method with the convenient allegro function "exists()".

	* po/es.po, scripts/.cvsignore, .cvsignore, po/.cvsignore:
	Updated .cvsignore files. Mostly in regards to gettext. Also added cheat.lua to scripts/.cvsignore.

	* release/make-release.sh:
	Ammended make-release.sh to link KQ with Windows gettext libraries.

	* src/win.c: KQ compiles for Windows again.

2008-01-13  wk2  <wk2@iMac.local>

	* release/make-release.sh:
	* Added a function for creating a Linux release for the mapeditor files. It still needs some touching up.

	* maps/mapedit.c, maps/mapshared.c, maps/mainwindow.c:
	* mapdraw and mapdraw2 first look for pcx files (and mapdraw2's mapdraw2.glade) in DATA_DIR/data/<file_name>, and if that
	fails, it looks in the current directory for these files.
	* mapdraw no longer loops through the pcx files if it can't find the required one. It halts if one is missing. This
	shouldn't happen anyway.

	* src/dos.c, src/intrface.c, src/unix.c, src/win.c, src/beos.c:
	* KQ now checks the user's home directory for resource files before it checks the KQ install directory.
	* Had to modify the way kqres handles scripts. It now requires that ".lob" and ".lua" be ommitted.
	* I probably broke MacOSX, because osx.m was written in a language I am unfamiliar with, and I would not have been able to
	test it anyway (no Mac)
	* I was unable to test the changes I made to beos.c, dos.c, and win.c.

2008-01-11  wk2  <wk2@iMac.local>

	* src/sgame.c:
	* Added a NULL terminator to the end of curmap when loading. Loading a game would fail in some unusual situations.

2007-12-03  edgarmolina  <edgarmolina@iMac.local>

	* src/draw.c:
	Added some more glyph indexes (no glyphs yet though) and 3 and 4 byte UTF-8 support, which will need checking. Invalid glyphs are logged, but appear as spaces and don't cause program_death any more.

	* src/credits.c: Added WinterKnight and updated year to 2007

2007-11-26  edgarmolina  <edgarmolina@iMac.local>

	Add support for Lua with a modified script from Yann Dirson for Wesnoth.

	luaxgettext only works with benign input files, but that shouldn't be a problem as we control all input files.

	Export the gettext function to lua.

2007-11-17  edgarmolina  <edgarmolina@iMac.local>

2007-09-02  wk2  <wk2@iMac.local>

	* scripts/cave5.lua: Fixed "blowup" bug that caused freeze.
	Thanks Jonathan Hepburn for the patch.

2007-09-01  wk2  <wk2@iMac.local>

	* src/unix.c:
	Reverted my previous comment in unix.c. mkdir has no effect on existing
	directories.

	* Makefile.am, include/combat.h, include/heroc.h, include/intrface.h, include/itemdefs.h, include/kq.h, include/magic.h, include/progress.h, include/res.h, include/sgame.h, include/shopmenu.h, include/structs.h, scripts/Makefile.am, scripts/allsc.txt, scripts/coliseum.lua, scripts/global.lua, scripts/init.lua, scripts/starting.lua, src/combat.c, src/disk.c, src/draw.c, src/enemyc.c, src/entity.c, src/heroc.c, src/intrface.c, src/kq.c, src/magic.c, src/menu.c, src/res.c, src/sgame.c, src/shopmenu.c, src/unix.c:
	Big changes. Geared towards removing content from C Code, and putting it into scripts.
	1) map_no
	2) removed progress.h
	3) shop into init.lua:init_shops
	4) lua lob
	5) separated progress to shops_time, save_spells, etc.
	6) malloc to fixed array

	1) Removed most of the code in progress.h and put it into global.lua
	2) map_no is no longer used, although mapdraw programs can still read and write it.
	3) Shops are no longer defined in code. They are now defined in init_shop in the new
	script init.lua. Added a s_shops structure to replace the funky multi-dimensional
	shops array.
	4) KQ will attempt to load the appropriate lob file from the scripts directory. If
	the lob file is not there, it will try to load the equivalent lua file. You do not
	have to compile scripts. You still have to "prepare" them if they use any item
	constants.
	5) The progress array was being used to store progress, shop visit times, and
	magical spell status. I split these into different arrays, maintaining backwards
	compatibility.
	6) Some arrays, such as progress, were inappropriately using malloc and free, when
	being declared with a fixed size would have been appropriate. I fixed some of these.

2007-08-31  wk2  <wk2@iMac.local>

	* maps/mapdraw2.c, maps/mapedit.c, maps/mapedit2.c, maps/mapfile.c, maps/mapshared.c:
	Fixed segfault in mapdraw2. Both mapdraw and mapdraw2 work OK now.
	Misc map fixes.

	* .cvsignore: Needed update. Should work better now.

2007-08-30  wk2  <wk2@iMac.local>

	* maps/mapdraw.h, maps/mapedit.c, maps/mapfile.c, maps/mapshared.c, maps/mapstructs.c:
	Fixed glibc abort in mapdraw. Markers would get added, but no memory would be allocated for them.
	I removed the markers array and superseded it with gmap.markers.

	* maps/camp.map, scripts/camp.lua:
	Reverted previous changes. They were designed to fix the "diagonal avoidance" bug, which has already been fixed.
	Instead, they introduce a bug. Specifically, they disallowed the player from completing Cassandra's side quest.

2007-08-29  teamterradactyl  <teamterradactyl@iMac.local>

	* maps/mapedit.c: Tightened a few loops

2007-08-29  wk2  <wk2@iMac.local>

	* readme.txt, setup.cfg, COPYING, COPYING.txt, fix.bat, fixbe.sh, fixosx.sh, fixunix.sh, kq.cfg, kq.gdt, kq.gpr:
	Removed several unnecessary files.

2007-08-20  wk2  <wk2@iMac.local>

	* maps/mapedit2.c: Slightly clarified convert_icon()

	* maps/mapdraw2.glade, maps/mapshared.c:
	Fixed segfault in mapdraw2. Changed mapdraw2 menu to English.

	* include/kq.h, include/structs.h, src/kq.c: Cleaned up code.

	"kq" so that the executable path detection in src/unix.c works.
