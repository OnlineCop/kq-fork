KQ Lives Again!
===============

What is KQ?
-----------

**KQ** is an old-skool console-style RPG.

Take the part as one of eight mighty heroes to search for the Staff of Xenarum.  Visit over twenty different locations, fight a multitude of evil monsters, wield deadly weapons and cast powerful spells. On your quest, you will find out how the Oracle knows everything, who killed the former master of the Embers guild, why no one trusts the old man in the manor, and what exactly is terrorizing the poor Denorians.

Who made KQ?
------------

**KQ** was originally developed by **Josh Bolduc** in 2001. The source code was then released in 2002 and the **[KQ Lives](http://sourceforge.net/projects/kqlives/)** team pursued its development from 2002 to 2010.

Now the game is being forked once again in the hope to modernize it and finish the story.

**grrk-bzzt** and **OnlineCop** are the maintainers of this project.

You can get in touch with us on IRC at **#kqfork** on ***irc.freenode.net***
