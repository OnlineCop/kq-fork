Create a new directory at C:\KQ

Download the MSVC precompiled library files and binaries from:
- http://cdn.allegro.cc/file/library/allegro/4.4.2/allegro-4.4.2-msvc-10.0.zip
- Extract the files, then rename the parent directory (the one above bin/, include/ and lib/) to `allegro`.

Download DUMB:
- https://sourceforge.net/projects/dumb/files/dumb/0.9.3/ selecting dumb-0.9.3.zip\
- Extract the files under C:\KQ\dumb

Download kq-fork:
- https://github.com/grrk-bzzt/kq-fork
- Clone the project under C:\KQ\kq-fork

Download Lua:
- https://www.lua.org/download.html and/or https://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.3.2.tar.gz
- Extract the files under C:\KQ\lua

Download TinyXML2:
- https://github.com/leethomason/tinyxml2 and click the `Clone or Download` link and choose to `Download ZIP`.
- Extract the files under C:\KQ\tinyxml2

Your directory should now look like:

C:\KQ
C:\KQ\allegro
C:\KQ\dumb
C:\KQ\kq-fork
C:\KQ\lua
C:\KQ\tinyxml2

-- Edit the `Include Directories` row, and add `C:\KQ\allegro\include`
- Close all dialog boxes with the `OK` buttons

Right-click the project name (`kq`) again and select `Add -> Existing Item`

=== DUMB 0.9.8 === (incomplete, not fully working)

Find C:\KQ\dumb\vc6\dumb.dsw and open it in Visual Studio. It will give a "One-way upgrade" warning: hit OK to migrate.
Switch the compilation from `Debug` to `Release` mode.
Right click the `aldumb` project in the Solution Explorer window, and choose Properties.
- Edit the `Configuration Properties / VC++ Directories / Include Directories` and add the same `C:\KQ\allegro\include` path as done in the earlier step.
