-- manor: Status of conversations when you are in the manor
--   (0) New game; you haven't spoken to the butler yet
--   (1) Nostik further explained your mission; you haven't spoken to butler
--   (2) Butler has spoken to you, or you have no new recruits yet
--   (3) You've recruited others and they're waiting around the table
--   (4) Nostik and co go to the shrine
--
-- players: Number of recruits in your party
--   (0) You haven't recruited anyone yet
--   (1)..(7) You have others in your party
--
-- manorparty[0-7]: Which recruits have joined your party
--   (0)..(8) Whether this character has been recruited into your party
--
--
-- Details:
--
-- When the game starts, Nostik debriefs everybody and offers to go into detail
-- for whoever wants to listen.  Everyone else leaves immediately (walks out
-- the door) and you're left at the table.
--
-- Before you can leave yourself, the butler, Hunert, will stop to talk to you
-- and fill you in, as well as give you some money to start the quest.
--
-- When you return to the manor, the dining room should be empty unless you
-- have 'recruited' other party members into your team.  If you have, then
-- those members are sitting in their places around the table.  When you speak
-- to Hunert, the butler, he will allow you to choose your party members and
-- whether they will lead or follow in the 2-person party.

-- Quick reference:

--  SENSAR   0
--  SARINA   1
--  CORIN    2
