KQ is an old skool console-style RPG.

Take the part of one of eight mighty heroes as you search for the
Staff of Xenarum.  Visit over twenty different locations, fight a
multitude of evil monsters, wield deadly weapons and cast powerful
spells. On your quest, you will find out how the Oracle knows
everything, who killed the former master of the Embers guild, why
no-one trusts the old man in the manor, and what exactly is
terrorizing the poor Denorians.

KQ is licensed under the GPL.
